gnome-games-extra-data 2.12.0
-----------------------------

This release is timed to match gnome-games 2.12.0. It can also be used
with gnome-games 2.10.0 since none of the data formats have changed.

Only one change, but its a biggie: David Bellot's SVG card theme has
been upgraded to the 2.0 version. It is well worth the download.

gnome-games-extra-data 2.10.0
-----------------------------

This release includes ports of the Same GNOME themes from the old
format to the 2.10 format. The old themes have been retained and can
be installed using the --enable-old argument to configure.

gnome-games-extra-data 2.8.0
----------------------------

The only change since 2.7.0 is the addition of the old gnometris
backgrounds. They are not installed since there is no suitable
location for them. They are provided for use on an ad hoc basis by any
interested parties (i.e. copy them to somewhere in your home directory).

gnome-games-extra-data 2.7.0
----------------------------

This is the initial release. Most of the graphics you will find here
were previously in the gnome-games package. There are two additional
tilesets for Mahjongg from Richard Hoelscher based on the old GNOME
1.4 graphics.
