GNOME Games Extra Data 2.20.0
-----------------------------
(No news.)

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.20.0
------------------------------

This is the stable realease of gnome-games-extra-data. This time we have a new
set of Anglo-American cards for aisleriot from Aike Reyer.

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.19.2
------------------------------

This development release of gnome-games-extra-data is
in sync with gnome-games 2.19.6.

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.19.1
------------------------------

This is a development release which is synchronized with
the 2.19.3 version of gnome-games. It is updated with themes
which are compatible with the new version of Aisleriot.
Packagers should note the new card theme path, which is documented
in the changelog. 

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.18.0
------------------------------

So, here it is, the latest stable release of the extra themes for
gnome-games. It is a stable release, with no changes since the
previous development version.

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.17.90
------------------------------

This is a beta release of the extra themes available for Gnome Games. During
the 2.16 release cycle, we skipped releasing any changes to this package but
the addition of a new Mahjong theme has neccessitated renewed attention.
Additionally, we are considering adding one more card theme before 2.18.0;
there may well be one more release of this package during this release cycle.

For now, here are the changes:

	* New Greek-Letter mahjongg theme from Jon Arney.
	* Remove paris.svg from gnome-games.


GNOME Games Extra Data 2.14.0
-----------------------------

I usually start these things off by saying that this release was timed
to match the gnome-games 2.14.0 release. Unfortunately that would be a
complete lie. It is horendously late and 2.14.1 has already been
released. On top of that you don't even need gnome-games 2.14, 2.12
will do just fine (and probably 2.10 as well, some of it will even
work with 2.0).

So, here it is, the latest release of the extra themes for
gnome-games. There are two great new themes here.

First up is Nicu Buculei's "Ornamental" card theme. It is slick,
cheerful and grogeous. You can find more card themes on his web site
at:

Second up is the "Matrix" Same GNOME theme from Adam and Filip
Dominec. It's actually quite hard to play with this theme, but it is
awesome eye candy.

Enjoy!

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.12.0
-----------------------------

This release is timed to match gnome-games 2.12.0. It can also be used
with gnome-games 2.10.0 since none of the data formats have changed.

Only one change, but its a biggie: David Bellot's SVG card theme has
been upgraded to the 2.0 version. It is well worth the download.

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.10.0
-----------------------------

This release includes ports of the Same GNOME themes from the old
format to the 2.10 format. The old themes have been retained and can
be installed using the --enable-old argument to configure.

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.8.0
----------------------------

The only change since 2.7.0 is the addition of the old gnometris
backgrounds. They are not installed since there is no suitable
location for them. They are provided for use on an ad hoc basis by any
interested parties (i.e. copy them to somewhere in your home directory).

GNOME Games Extra Data 2.7.0
----------------------------

This is the initial release. Most of the graphics you will find here
were previously in the gnome-games package. There are two additional
tilesets for Mahjongg from Richard Hoelscher based on the old GNOME
1.4 graphics.
