gnome-games-extra-data 2.14.0
-----------------------------

I usually start these things off by saying that this release was timed
to match the gnome-games 2.14.0 release. Unfortunately that would be a
complete lie. It is horendously late and 2.14.1 has already been
released. On top of that you don't even need gnome-games 2.14, 2.12
will do just fine (and probably 2.10 as well, some of it will even
work with 2.0).

So, here it is, the latest release of the extra themes for
gnome-games. There are two great new themes here.

First up is Nicu Buculei's "Ornamental" card theme. It is slick,
cheerful and grogeous. You can find more card themes on his web site
at:

Second up is the "Matrix" Same GNOME theme from Adam and Filip
Dominec. It's actually quite hard to play with this theme, but it is
awesome eye candy.

Enjoy!

gnome-games-extra-data 2.12.0
-----------------------------

This release is timed to match gnome-games 2.12.0. It can also be used
with gnome-games 2.10.0 since none of the data formats have changed.

Only one change, but its a biggie: David Bellot's SVG card theme has
been upgraded to the 2.0 version. It is well worth the download.

gnome-games-extra-data 2.10.0
-----------------------------

This release includes ports of the Same GNOME themes from the old
format to the 2.10 format. The old themes have been retained and can
be installed using the --enable-old argument to configure.

gnome-games-extra-data 2.8.0
----------------------------

The only change since 2.7.0 is the addition of the old gnometris
backgrounds. They are not installed since there is no suitable
location for them. They are provided for use on an ad hoc basis by any
interested parties (i.e. copy them to somewhere in your home directory).

gnome-games-extra-data 2.7.0
----------------------------

This is the initial release. Most of the graphics you will find here
were previously in the gnome-games package. There are two additional
tilesets for Mahjongg from Richard Hoelscher based on the old GNOME
1.4 graphics.
