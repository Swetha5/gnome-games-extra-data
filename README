gnome-games-extras-data

This package contains extra data files for the gnome-games package. At
the moment this is almost entirely extra themes and artwork for the
games.

The package has no dependencies. Currently you need gnome-games to
take advantage of this artwork, but hopefully in the future this
artwork can be used by other packages.

Copying of this package is covered under under the GPL, see the file
COPYING for details. An exception to this is cards/dondorf.svg which is in
the public domain.
